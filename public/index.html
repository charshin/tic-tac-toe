<!--
  In development environment (using webpack-dev-server, also non-SSR):
  This HTML file serves as a template, scripts will be added for the final built index.html (generated by html-webpack-plugin)
  in order to load bundled js files, which would launch our React app.

  In non-development environments (i.e. SSR):
  You must make sure that the content of server/Html.js matches the content of this template.

  For both SSR & non-SSR environments, SEOs information should be rendered (via react-helmet)
  into either the final built index.html (non-SSR) or the rendered html string (SSR).
